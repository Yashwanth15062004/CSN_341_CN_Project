# CSN-341_CN_Project
## Overview

The project focuses on simulating a dynamic cloud environment with CloudSim. It explores cost and time optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Task Scheduling with Shortest Job First (SJF), and Virtual Machine allocation with WICS algorithm. The implementation includes a server-client model with performance monitoring, load balancing, and cost optimization strategies.Check "Group 8.docx" file for detailed process of execution.

## Algorithms Used For SIMULATIONS

### Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

PSO is employed for optimizing costs and time within the simulated cloud environment. This algorithm is utilized to dynamically adjust resource allocation to achieve optimal performance.

### Shortest Job First (SJF) Task Scheduling

The SJF algorithm is used for task scheduling in the simulated cloud environment. It aims to minimize the turnaround time by prioritizing tasks with the shortest execution time.

### WICS for VM's Allocation

WicWSm (Whatever it cost Whatever Service Model) is implemented for Virtual Machine allocation. This algorithm considers both cost and service requirements when allocating VMs to optimize the overall performance.

## Implementation
### SERVER-CLIENT IMPLEMENTATION

The dynamic cloud environment is implemented using a server-client model. It includes features such as performance monitoring, load balancing, and cost optimization. Auto-scaling is integrated to adapt to changing workloads dynamically.
